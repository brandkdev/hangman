# Hangman - ruby

This is a hangman game written in Ruby. Here's how it works:

There is a word between 5 & 12 characters long that is randomly selected from the text file, you have to enter a character 1 at a time as your guess. If the character is a part of the word, it will populate on your screen. If the word does not contain that character, you get a strike added. If you hit 6 strikes, it's game over. 

You can save your game to pick it back up later.
